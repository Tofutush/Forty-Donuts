		<spoiler text="Notes">
			<p>- Every instance of "god" or "gog" is replaced with "boy".</p>
			<p>- Content warnings: basically Homestuck level. If you can read through the entirety of Homestuck, you'll be able to handle this.</p>

		<spoiler text="Author's pathetic inner monologue (TL;DR)">
			<p>First of all, hey reader, thank you for clicking into this little adventure for whatever reason. Mostly because you saw it on the "recently updated" section.</p>
			<p>Now, this is my first ever Homestuck fanventure. I'm still even relatively new to this <a href="https://mspfa.com">mspfa site</a>. However, I already have this adventure planned from Alternia to Earth C, the entire journey of the trolls and kids. (I won't say no to suggestions though.) I know that a lot of adventures probably follow this timeline pattern: Start -- lots of grand plans for future plot -- rising fanbase -- author cancells it because they've lost their childhood dreams and goals -- declining fanbase -- unfinished fanventure lying in the depths of the metaverse, never to be found again.</p>
			<p>I know that Forty Donuts will probably end like that. I know that you'd probably know it too. But I genuenly (idk how to spell that word not native english speaker sorry) hope it won't. I'm currently in high school, and suffering from a multitude of problems from physical to financial to emotional. Homestuck (along with some other works of fiction) is basically my entire emotional support. Sometimes I zone out and start thinking of imaginary scenes in my head, which I really love and adore (and which I later knew as ADHD-I). That's why I really want to see my grand vision out on your screen and not just in my head. This is going to sound like crap for future me. But at least for now, that's what I want.</p>
			<p>Readers, I know this sounds like crap and I know you read this a thousand times, but please comment and show your support! Comment when you think someone is out-of-character, comment when you have a suggestion, and comment when you think there's something weird with the art. Comment ANYTHING! (Leave Vriscourse out though. thanks.) Your support is what keeps me going. (I'm serious cuz no one around me reads homestuck, only ppl on the internet do.) I will also do my best to reply to your comments.</p>
			<p>Finally, regarding the first-ever comment I received. I know Eridan is a controversial character, and some people might even turn away from a fanventure because Eridan's in it. Please don't, since then you might miss some great fanventures like Be The Sea Dweller Lowblood. Eridan is my patron troll; he's far from my favorite character but also far from the least fav. He is the second troll to appear (first canon troll) for obvious plot reasons. But the thing I want to clarify is that as douchey as he is, he is well-written and interesting, like most characters in Homestuck. With these characters, it's not hard to make them FUNNY. Funny! This is exactly what the "hilarity ensues" in the description means. Everyone gets to crack jokes!</p>
			<p>Whoa, I have no idea I had written this much. Thank you for sticking with me. Now go and stick with this little fanventure I made with all my heart.</p>

		<p>You mean, Nepeta told her that FLARP was dangerous. She not only believed it, but also got so afraid of it that she basically freaked out when you mentioned it. Either she regards Nepeta as her firm life belief or she's just stupid. You're sure it's the latter.</p>

		<p>To be honest you hardly even need a gun anyways. The old one you had didn't even shoot bullets. It shoots some kind of thorny vine that clings onto things, like the way Spidertroll shoots webs. The upside is that you'll never have to load it.</p>
		<p>But it's always cool to get a gun! Just in case you haven't mentioned yet, you are an apex crack shot.</p>

			<p>Turns out, my old pen was SOOOO old it was barely functioning anymore. Guess what. I didn't even notice! Because the tip of that old pen was being worn out bit by bit, only a tiny bit each time I used it. It was impossible to notice the difference each time I used it. But all those tiny bits accumulated together made a terrible pen. And I kept on using it, thinking it was normal.</p>
			<p>Which makes me wonder if there are other things, really bad things I haven't noticed, thinking it was normal! Maybe I have to question the way I do stuff every day, and it will lead to unexpected stuff!</p>

		<spoiler text="Friends, I made a huge decision">
			<spoiler text="short story">
				<p>I decided to make an original comic, still posted on both MSPFA and tofutush.github.io. The main character is still Sparky, but not related to Sparky here in Forty Donuts.</p>
			</spoiler>
			<spoiler text="long story">
				<p>So this Sparky, she has like, a backstory.</p>
				<p>A backstory that involves a bunch of original characters and an original plot.</p>
				<p>So I was like, if so many things are original, then why keep it as a Homestuck fan comic? Why not make it <i>completely</i> original?</p>
				<p>In the end I decided that I would draw a comic about a bunch of superpowered bunny people doing stuff in China, but it's not really China because everyone speaks English for some reason. And the culture's like 50% eastern and 50% western and 100% Alternian. And in that world, fictional countries from <i>The Adventures of Tintin</i> are all canon, like Syldavia and Borduria and stuff, because I like Tintin. (Just some homage-y joke, countries don't matter in the comic anyways)</p>
				<p>The backstory of Sparky in Forty Donuts will be changed back to my first idea: Sparky used to learn drawing with Amisia. And she got freaked out by the blood-paint. That's it.</p>
				<p>This comic will be drawn in a more traditional format, all panels and bubbles and stuff, unlike classic MSPA</p>
				<p>I will post it to this site on August 13th.</p>
				<p>The name? Prospit's Requiem.</p>
				<p>I will also be posting this comic to Webtoons, <a href="https://tapas.io/series/Prospits-Requiem">Tapas</a>, and <a href="https://globalcomix.com/c/prospit-s-requiem">Globalcomix</a>.</p>
				<p>Do note that Prospit's Requiem will likely be focused on more than Forty Donuts. Mostly because it's original this time.</p>

			<l c="violet"><s>eridan</s><d>oh boy oh FUCK</d></l>
			<l c="sparky"><s>sparky</s><d>You don't like this idea? It's fine! We can also post out a "mising book" notice writen in dolphin language and hope some friendly dolphin down there can return it to us! We'l just have to include the precise longitude and latitude of our ship. Can you calculate that?</d></l>
