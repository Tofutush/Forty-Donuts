			<br/>
			<p>In which Sparky gets roped into FLARPing by Eridan, and they get stuck on the first step: coming up with a team name.</p>
			<p>Team Garbage? Sounds great.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>CHARACTERS: <c c="#0cf">Sparky</c>, <c c="#6a006a">Eridan</c>, <c c="#008282">Terezi</c>, <c c="#005682">Vriska</c>, <c c="#a10000">Aradia</c>, <c c="#a15000">Tavros</c>, <c c="#426600">Nepeta</c> (flashback).</p>

			<p>DEVIATION FROM HOMESTUCK: Not much. Actually it's not going to differ a lot to the canon trolls until right before they enter the game. <i>Objectif Luna</i></p>
			<br/>
			<p><s s="40px">Notes</s></p>
			<p>- Every instance of "god" or "gog" is replaced with "boy".</p>
			<p>- Content warnings: basically Homestuck level. If you can read through the entirety of Homestuck, you'll be able to handle this.</p>
			<p>- I use a VPN to access Google Login API, because mspfa doesn't host accounts. So if I go for long without updating, it probably just means my vpn expired. No matter what, I will make this comic when I have time, even if they aren't uploaded to <a href="https://mspfa.com">this site</a>.</p>
			<p>- Sometimes I will add the text before I add the pictures. I won't notify readers when it's only a text-edit, but sometimes I forget anyways. Sorry :(</p>
			<br/>
			<p><s s="40px">Author's pathetic inner monologue</s></p>
			<p>First of all, hey reader, thank you for clicking into this little adventure for whatever reason. Mostly because you saw it on the "recently updated" section.</p>
			<p>Now, this is my first ever Homestuck fanventure. I'm still even relatively new to this <a href="https://mspfa.com">mspfa site</a>. However, I already have this adventure planned from Alternia to Earth C, the entire journey of the trolls and kids. (I won't say no to suggestions though.) I know that a lot of adventures probably follow this timeline pattern: Start -- lots of grand plans for future plot -- rising fanbase -- author cancells it because they've lost their childhood dreams and goals -- declining fanbase -- unfinished fanventure lying in the depths of the metaverse, never to be found again.</p>
			<p>I know that Forty Donuts will probably end like that. I know that you'd probably know it too. But I genuenly (idk how to spell that word not native english speaker sorry) hope it won't. I'm currently in high school, and suffering from a multitude of problems from physical to financial to emotional. Homestuck (along with some other works of fiction) is basically my entire emotional support. Sometimes I zone out and start thinking of imaginary scenes in my head, which I really love and adore (and which I later knew as ADHD-I). That's why I really want to see my grand vision out on your screen and not just in my head. This is going to sound like crap for future me. But at least for now, that's what I want.</p>
			<p>Readers, I know this sounds like crap and I know you read this a thousand times, but please comment and show your support! Comment when you think someone is out-of-character, comment when you have a suggestion, and comment when you think there's something weird with the art. Comment ANYTHING! (Leave Vriscourse out though. thanks.) Your support is what keeps me going. (I'm serious cuz no one around me reads homestuck, only ppl on the internet do.) I will also do my best to reply to your comments.</p>
			<p>Finally, regarding the first-ever comment I received. I know Eridan is a controversial character, and some people might even turn away from a fanventure because Eridan's in it. Please don't, since then you might miss some great fanventures like Be The Sea Dweller Lowblood. Eridan is my patron troll; he's far from my favorite character but also far from the least fav. He is the second troll to appear (first canon troll) for obvious plot reasons. But the thing I want to clarify is that as douchey as he is, he is well-written and interesting, like most characters in Homestuck. With these characters, it's not hard to make them FUNNY. Funny! This is exactly what the "hilarity ensues" in the description means. Everyone gets to crack jokes!</p>
			<p>Whoa, I have no idea I had written this much. Thank you for sticking with me. Now go and stick with this little fanventure I made with all my heart.</p>

			<p>Seriously, ever since she went into the forest she has eaten nothing but unidentified wild animal meat Pittsburgh-rare, and berries that may or may not be poisonous. And chalk.</p>
			<p>Yes, the kind of chalk used to draw stuff on the blackboard.</p>
			<p>Speaking of blackboards, she hasn't seen them in a long time either. Not since Amisia... Hey, check out that cool cloud! Ooh it's in the shape of...</p>

			<p>Yeah, you're PRETTY sure your name isn't Donutmania. First of all it's supposed to be six letters. Second, "Derpeyes" is a horrible last name. Your own last name is way cooler than that, with a fascinating backstory.</p>
